Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742 (1998), this Court held that under Title VII, an employer is vicariously liable for severe or pervasive workplace harassment by a supervisor of the victim. If the harasser was the victim's co-employee, however, the employer is not liable absent proof of negligence. In the decision below, the Seventh Circuit held that actionable harassment by a person whom the employer deemed a \"supervisor\" and who had the authority to direct and oversee the victim's daily work could not give rise to vicarious liability because the harasser did not also have the power to take formal employment actions against her. The question presented is:\nWhether, as the Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits have held, the Faragher and Ellerth \"supervisor\" liability rule (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victim's daily work, or, as the First, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits have held (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to \"hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline\" their victim."}

The Court declined to apply the test from Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). In this case, the court of appeals held that the Town of Greece violated the Establishment Clause by allowing volunteer private citizens to open town board meetings with a prayer. Though the Town had never regulated the content of the prayers, had permitted any citizen from any religious tradition to volunteer to be a prayer-giver, and did not discriminate in selecting prayer-givers, the court struck down the Town's prayer practice, applying an \"en dorsement\" test derived from Lemon.  See App. 17a. \nWhether the court of appeals erred in holding that a legislative prayer practice violates the Establishment Clause notwithstanding the absence of discrimination in the selection of prayer-givers or forbidden exploitation of the prayer opportunity."}

The FDA lacks the authority and expertise needed to verify the patent information submitted by name-brand drug companies, however, so it defers to their descriptions of the scope of their patents. Such companies can therefore block the approval of generic drugs by submitting overbroad patent descriptions to the FDA, effectively extending their patents to cover non-infringing uses. To combat this problem, the Act allows a \"counterclaim seeking an order requiring the [patent] holder to correct or delete the patent information submitted by the holder * * * on the ground that the patent does not claim * * * an approved method of using the drug.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I).

That ruling expressly invalidates longstanding FDA regulations defining \"patent information,\" which the FDA deems \"essential\" to administering the Act, without seeking the agency's views.

Perry, 417 U.S. 21 (1974), and Menna v. New York, 423 U.S. 61 (1975), this Court held that a defendant who pleads guilty can still raise on appeal any constitutional claim that does not depend on challenging his \"factual guilt.\" In Blackledge and Menna, the Court held that double jeopardy and vindictive prosecution are two such claims that are not inherently resolved by pleading guilty, because those claims do not challenge whether the government could properly meet its burden of proving each element of the crime.\n\nIn the years since this Court decided Blackledge and Menna, the circuit courts have deeply divided on whether a defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of his statute of conviction survives a plea, or instead is inherently waived as part of the concession of factual guilt.\n\nThe question presented is:\nWhether a guilty plea inherently waives a defendant's right to challenge the constitutionality of his statute of conviction?"}

Railway Clerks, this Court unanimously \u201cdetermined that the [Railway Labor Act], as informed by the First Amendment, prohibits the use of dissenters\u2019 [union] fees for extraunit litigation.\u201d Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Ass\u2019n, 500 U.S. 507, 528 (1991) (opinion of Blackmun, J., citing Ellis, 466 U.S. 435, 453 (1984)). In Lehnert, a four-member plurality therefore held \u201cthat the Amendment proscribes such assessments in the public sector.\u201d Id. Moreover, Justice Scalia\u2019s separate opinion, concurring in part in the judgment announced by Justice Blackmun, reasoned that \u201cthere is good reason to treat [Ellis and the Court\u2019s other statutory cases] as merely reflecting the constitutional rule.\u201d Id. at 555.\nMay a State, nonetheless, consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, condition continued public employment on the payment of agency fees for purposes of financing a monopoly bargaining agent\u2019s affiliates\u2019 litigation outside of a nonunion employee\u2019s bargaining unit?"}

In federal habeas proceedings, undersigned counsel raised for the first time a claim under Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate the extraordinary mitigating evidence in Mr. Trevino's life. The federal proceeding was stayed to allow exhaustion, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Mr. Trevino's Wiggins claim under state abuse of the writ rules. Thereafter, the federal district court dismissed the claim as procedurally barred, finding no cause for the default. On appeal, Mr. Trevino argued that the Court of Appeals should stay further proceedings until this Court resolved the question then-pending in several cases whether ineffective assistance of state habeas counsel in failing to raise a meritorious claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel established cause for the default in state habeas proceedings. The Court of Appeals refused to stay Mr. Trevino's appeal for this purpose. Four months later, this Court decided in Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S.Ct. 1309 (March 20, 2012), that ineffective assistance of state habeas counsel in the very circumstance presented by Mr. Trevino's case could establish cause for the default of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. These circumstances present the following question:\nWhether the Court should grant certiorari, vacate the Court of Appeals opinion, and remand to the Court of Appeals for consideration of Mr. Trevino's argument under Martinez v. Ryan?"}
